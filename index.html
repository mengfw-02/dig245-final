        <h1>Hi! I'm Habiter.</h1>
        <p>Habiter is a habit tracker robot designed to motivate users to establish
          good habits for a time period of 30-days. As an online interactive platform,
          Habiter provides users a more personalized and private way of keeping track of
          habit completion. Habiter acts as a chatbot that asks the users questions as a
          check-in method. This chatting type of communication will thus alleviate some of
          the stress the users might experience when using other forms of habit tracker,
          such as writing down on paper. Habiter allows users to check-in and mark down
          their habit just as if they were texting to their friends. </p>

        <p>To motivate users to check-in every day, Habiter implements the idea of growing a plant.
          For every 6-days of completion of a habit, the flower associated with that habit will
          gain a different color of petal. The goal is to achieve all
          colors of the petals, which can be accomplished if there is a 30-days completion.
          The reason for this 30-days time period is because we believe that once a habit is
          established, it’s much harder to get rid of, and we think 30-days is the
          perfect time period to ensure a habit is established. </p>

        <p>
          A dark-side of habiter is tracking. Habiter is built with cookies, which
          store all of the habits, so when users come back to the page, their habits
          are still there. This usage of cookies is also intended to remind users of the dangerous
          side of technology, as Habiter also uses these habits to generate relevant products
          for users to purchase. The duality of the Habiter’s purpose, as both a product
          of convenience and tracking, is an analogy of the products we use in this
          digital age: we use our data to pay for free usage.
